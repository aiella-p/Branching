Branching 
-------------
 Master is called default branching of git.whatever activities we are done so far is in Master branch. We can create our own branch and can put data on it. When we are working on loans related functionality we are telling the developers to put code related to loans in this branch loans. once all this is done in this branch we are merging this branch with master branch. this feature is called Branching.
